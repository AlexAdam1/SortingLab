Q. Why did I select this particular sorting algorithm?
A. I chose this particular sorting algorithm because unfortunately it is the only algorithm that I've learned about. Given the nested for loop, the optimization of this program is very poor, but I hope to be able to optimize perfectly and effectively as I learn more

Q. What was my challenges in performing the lab (from design to the implementation phases)?
A. There weren't many challenges I faced in performing this lab, but I did have some complications as I was creating the sorting algorithm. I hadn't accustomed myself to nested for loop entirely, so it took me some time to figure out the order.
